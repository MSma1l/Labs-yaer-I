    <p><h3>When Mercedes introduced the CLE-class last summer, it represented a paring down of the automaker's coupe lineup. The CLE coupe is meant to replace the discontinued C-class and E-class coupes, and now, the CLE range is growing slightly with the introduction of the CLE-class cabriolet. While only the European version has been shown so far, a Mercedes-Benz representative confirmed to Car and Driver the model will arrive in the U.S. for 2024. Like the coupe, the CLE cabriolet looks chic thanks to its upscale design, and it will offer a pair of electrified powertrains and a tech-focused interior.</h3></p>

    </div>
   <p><h3>All available powertrains for the CLE Cabriolet include 48-volt hybrid system, with the electric motor providing a boost of 23 horsepower and 148 pound-feet. While Europe gets both a diesel option and a less powerful base engine, the North American version of the cabriolet will likely come in the same four-cylinder CLE300 and six-cylinder CLE450 options as the coupe.</h3></p>

    </div>
    <p><h3>That means the base CLE300 is powered by the M254 engine, a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four producing 255 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque. Stepping up to the CLE450 brings the M256 powertrain, a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six pumping out a stout 375 horsepower and 369 pound-feet.</h3>

	<h3>Offering some room for individuality, the softtop is available in black, red, or gray. It's power-operated and can be closed in under 20 seconds while driving up to 37 mph. Both Mercedes's Aircap wind deflection system and Airscarf ventilation system come standard, with the deflection system directing cold air over the front passenger's heads, and the Airscarf pumping out warm air.</h3></p>

        <h3>Inside the new CLE cabriolet, the cabin matches one-for-one with the coupe. The 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster sits behind the steering wheel, and there's a 11.9-inch central touchscreen with an angle that can be adjusted from 15 to 40 degrees to prevent glare when the top is lowered. According to Mercedes, the front seats were designed specifically for this model and feature a reflective coating to prevent the leather from becoming scalding in the summer; we tested a similar setup in the previous E-class convertible and found that the seats can still get plenty hot.</h3></p>
