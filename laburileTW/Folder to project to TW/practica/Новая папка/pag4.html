    <p><h3>We've known for a while now that Honda was working on a hydrogen-powered version of the CR-V compact SUV, and now we can see the new CR-V fuel cell (FCEV) that will reach the U.S. later this year. To no one's surprise, it looks like, well, a CR-V, although there are some differences in the front-end design. Most notably, the grille shape and lower fascia are different, and the headlights are revised as well.</h3>

	<h3>Underneath, the CR-V fuel cell will be significantly different from the hybrid and nonhybrid versions we currently get. It will use a fuel cell unit that converts liquid hydrogen fuel into electricity to power an electric motor, and it will also differ from other hydrogen-powered vehicles such as the Toyota Mirai and Hyundai Nexo in that it will offer plug-in capability. This means that you'll be able to plug in the CR-V to juice up a small battery pack that will also supply power to the electric motor. We're not sure exactly how much electric range this will add, but we expect Honda to release specs soon.</h3>

	<h3>The CR-V's fuel cell power unit is being built in Michigan as part of a joint venture between Honda and General Motors. Production has already begun, and we expect the CR-V fuel cell to start sales later this year. It's unclear at this point if Honda will use a lease model or allow retail sales, and it's likely to only be available in California, the only state with any sort of hydrogen fueling infrastructure.</h3></p>
