    <p><h3>Electric cars are the future, and each year we've seen automakers add more EVs to their lineups. Everyone is working on electric vehicles, from well-established existing manufacturers to new names such as Lucid, Canoo, and Rivian. We've compiled a list of every electric vehicle, from concept to production, that isn't available yet but will be soon.</h3>

        <h3>Acura ZDX (Expected: Early 2024)</h3>
        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-acura-zdx-104-64dcee8c7e29e.jpg?crop=0.796xw:0.730xh;0.117xw,0.0995xh&resize=980:*" alt="fine">
    </div>
    <p><h3>You may recognize the ZDX name from Acura's old coupe-SUV model, but this time around the moniker adorns a midsize crossover that becomes Acura's first EV when it arrives early next year. The 2024 ZDX rides on General Motors' Ultium battery platform—sharing components with the Cadillac Lyriq—and the 102.0-kWh battery will provide up to 325 miles of range. The 340-hp, single-motor, rear-wheel-drive A-Spec model will be joined by a 500-hp, dual-motor, all-wheel-drive Type S, which also wears upgraded brakes, adaptive dampers, and air suspension. The A-Spec should start around $60,000. —Caleb Miller</h3></p>

        <h3>Alfa Romeo Giulia EV (Expected: 2025)</h3>
        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2023-alfa-romeo-giulia-quadrifoglio-101-1667326905.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.918xh;0,0.0230xh&resize=980:*" alt="fine">
    </div>
    <p><h3>Alfa Romeo has confirmed the gas-powered Giulia (seen above) will be revamped in the coming years, dropping its Ferrari-derived V-6 in favor of an electric powertrain for 2025. We expect the base version will make around 350 horsepower, while the Veloce will produce closer to 800 horsepower. The top-of-the-line Giulia will continue to carry the historic Quadrifoglio name and should make upwards of 1000 horsepower. The new Giulia will be produced on the Stellantis Group's STLA Large platform, with 800-volt, ultra-rapid charging and a range of up to 500 miles. —Jack Fitzgerald</h3></p>

        <h3>Audi A6 e-tron (Expected: 2024)</h3>
        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/audi-a6-e-tron-concept-104gg-1619458115.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:*" alt="fine">
    </div>
    <p><h3>The Audi A6 e-tron is a concept for now, but Audi says it's super close to what the production car will look like. It's based on the scalable Premium Platform Electric (PPE) architecture that can be lengthened, lifted, and widened for a variety of different EV models. It will be sold alongside the gas-powered A6 and will join the PPE-based Q6 e-tron crossover in Audi's lineup. The A6 e-tron concept uses two electric motors with a combined output of 469 horsepower. All PPE vehicles have 800-volt charging capability, and this big sedan could have as much as 400 miles of range on a single charge. —Austin Irwin</h3></p>
